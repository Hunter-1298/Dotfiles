Try:\n```bash\n# Activate your project's virtual environment first, then\nacjk ac ac\n```\n\n2. **Installation Verification**: Double-check if matplotlib is actually installed in the correct environment:\n```bash\npip list | grep matplotlib\n# or\npython -c \"import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.__version__)\"\n```\n\n3. **IDE Configuration**: If you're using an IDE (like VSCode or PyCharm), it might not be pointing to the correct Python interpreter. Make sure your IDE is using the same Python environment where matplotlib is installed.\n\n4. **Import Style**: Sometimes using a different import style can help:\n```python\n# Try these alternatives\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# or\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot\n```\n\n5. **Package Name**: Make sure you installed the correct package name:\n```bash\npip install matplotlib\n```\n\n6. **Python Version Compatibility**: Ensure you're using a compatible Python version with your matplotlib version.\n\nTo resolve this:\n1. Verify your virtual environment is activated\n2. Install matplotlib in the correct environment\n3. Confirm the installation was successful\n4. Restart your IDE/editor\n5. Try running your code again\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":53}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":19},"start":304,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":54}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":20},"start":1740,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":55}}}],"summary":"Matplotlib Import Resolution Issue Help","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":3,"end":243},"icon":"Warning","label":"Diagnostics: 1 errors","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":15,"end":242},"icon":"File","label":"AMR/src/models/encoder.py","metadata":null},{"range":{"start":41,"end":242},"icon":"XCircle","label":"Import \"matplotlib\" could not be resolved","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[]}
